## 📝 What is Manglaria?

<p align="leading">Manglaria is an interactive experience designed to educate and inspire people about the importance of mangrove ecosystems through engaging gameplay. By turning players into eco-heroes, Manglaria guides them through different challenges to clean up pollution, restore wildlife habitats, and fight deforestation—all while learning about real-world environmental issues. Every choice matters, and every mission helps rebuild a healthier ecosystem. 🌎 </p>

> This challenge is just the beginning. My goal is to continue using technology to inspire change and create apps that leave a meaningful impact. I hope Manglaria encourages more people to see conservation not as a chore, but as an adventure where we can all be heroes! 🌱💙
